Quick code for using the open ephys bnc breakout board (http://www.open-ephys.org/store/io-board-pcb) and some of the measurement computing DAQs we have lying around (USB 1208fs; https://www.mccdaq.com/PDFs/Manuals/usb-1208fs.pdf) to make a quick 8 input syncing device.

Will add design schematics later.
